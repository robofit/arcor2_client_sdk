# Showcase console application for ClientServices
This project features a trivial CLI application using the Arcor2.ClientSdk.ClientServices library.
It maps most available RPC methods to console commands, offering a convenient way to test and experiment with functionalities of the ARCOR2 server manually.

In addition to serving as a testing tool, this project also acts as a basic demonstration of how to use the library.
However, keep in mind that this implementation does not showcase every feature and mechanism of the library, 
such as all the different overloads, data update notifications, or event handling. 
For production-level applications, a more complete, object-oriented design is recommended.
